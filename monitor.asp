Though John is in the current consensus camp at this level, his particular valid theories about what qualia are and where they are located diverge from the majority. The <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/14" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/14" rel="nofollow">Smythies-Carr Hypothesis camp</a> is a competitor to the more well accepted <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/17" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/17" rel="nofollow">Mind-Brain Identity Theory camp</a>. The experts in that camp believe the best theory is that qualia are something in our brain in a growing set of diverse, possible, and concisely stated ways. The people in John's camp believe qualia are a property of something causally connected to, yet contained in the higher dimensional space described in string theory.</p>} },

<p>The open survey system at <a href="http://canonizer.com" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com" rel="nofollow">canonizer.com</a> is being used by a growing group of experts in this field to concisely state and rigorously measure how much <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11" rel="nofollow">scientific consensus</a> there is for the best theories of consciousness. It also includes a history mechanism making it possible to track which theories are becoming more popular, which ones are fading, and so on, as ever more scientific data comes in.</p>
<p>This topic on the best theories of consciousness is just getting started, but already a <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" rel="nofollow">Consciousness is Representational and Real</a> camp, based on a type of representative realism, has established a clear early lead at how well it is developed and how much support it has. Leading Experts such as [<a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" rel="nofollow">John Smythies</a> (canonizer nick name: <a href="http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=97" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=97" rel="nofollow">john locke</a>), and <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" rel="nofollow">Steven Lehar</a> (canonizer nick name: <a href="http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=88" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=88" rel="nofollow">slehar</a>), and a growing number of others are already participating in this survey.</p>
<p>The members of this camp and the various supporting sub camps believe no other theory of consciousness will ever be able to match the amount of <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11" rel="nofollow">scientific consensus</a> this camp will be able to achieve going forward. And ultimately that demonstrable scientific proof will convert everyone into this camp revealing it to be THE ONE true theory of consciousness. The primary goal of canonizer.com is not to determine truth via popularity, but to simply rigorously measure how much support there is for all accepted theories, especially the good minority ones, and the best terminology to use to describe such, going forward as scientific evidence continues to come in at ever increasing rates.</p>

<p>There are lots of famous people that have argued for and against the importance of the idea of qualia.  But is there a significant amount of scientific consensus on either side of this issue.  The open survey system at <a href="http://canonizer.com" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com" rel="nofollow">canonizer.com</a> is being developed by a growing grass roots group of people to rigorously measure <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81" rel="nofollow">scientific consensus</a>.

All experts and non experts are invited to quantitatively communicate to everyone what they currently think on this issue.
</p><p>Out of the gate the scientific consensus is clearly in the pro qualia <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" rel="nofollow">Consciousness is representational and real</a> camp  with such distinguished supporters as <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" rel="nofollow">Steven Lehar</a>, <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" rel="nofollow">John Smythies</a> and a growing number of others.

<p>The debate for and against representative realism has likely been raging for as long as there have been philosophers.  How has the amount of consensus amongst experts for one side or the other changed over history.  Could a revolution be taking place and one side significantly breaking out in the lead amongst experts during the last few decades.

There is a new topic getting started on <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" rel="nofollow">theories of consciousness</a>.  All experts and non experts are invited to quantitatively communicate to everyone what they currently think on this issue.  The more people that get involved, the more comprehensive the survey data will be.
</p><p>Out of the gate the scientific consensus is clearly in the <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" rel="nofollow">Consciousness is representational and real</a> camp with such distinguished supporters as <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" rel="nofollow">Steven Lehar</a>, <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" rel="nofollow">John Smythies</a> and a growing number of others.  But perhaps this early lead is just because supporters of some other more well accepted theory of consciousness haven't yet started supporting their ideas here.  
</p><p>There is obviously always the possibility that demonstrable scientific results are about to be achieved that will convert everyone to the 'true' camp.  Surely such, the scientific discovery of what the mind truly is, would be amongst the greatest scientific achievements of all time.  Or maybe the camps that claim we will never know are the ones that are right.
