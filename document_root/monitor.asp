<p><a href="/wiki/David_Chalmers" title="David Chalmers">David Chalmers</a> formulated the <a href="/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" title="Hard problem of consciousness">Hard problem of consciousness</a> raising the issue of qualia to a new level of importance and acceptance in the field. In his definitive paper <a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html" class="external text" title="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html" rel="nofollow">Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia</a> he also argued for what he called "The principle of organizational invariance." "The invariance principle holds that any functional isomorph of a conscious system has experiences that are qualitatively identical to those of the original system" making a powerful argument for what and how qualia are or must be. Currently, this theory about the nature of qualia is being concisely represented and defended by the members of the <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/8" class="external text" title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/8" rel="nofollow">Consciousness Arises from Any Equivalent Functional Organization camp</a> at canonizer.com.

<p>The debate for and against representative realism has likely been raging for as long as there have been philosophers.  How has the amount of consensus amongst experts for one side or the other changed over history?  Could a revolution be taking place and one side significantly breaking out in the lead amongst experts during the last few decades?
</p><p>There is a tool being developed at <a class="external"  title="http://canonizer.com" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Outbound&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanonizer.com">canonizer.com</a> with the goal of rigorously measuring <a class="external"  title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Outbound&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanonizer.com%2Ftopic.asp%2F81">scientific consensus</a> going forward.

All experts and non experts are invited to quantitatively communicate to everyone what they currently think on this issue.  The more people that get involved, the more comprehensive the survey data will be.
</p><p>Out of the gate the scientific consensus is clearly in the <a class="external"  title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Outbound&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanonizer.com%2Ftopic.asp%2F88%2F6">Consciousness is representational and real</a> camp with such distinguished supporters as <a class="external"  title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/4" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Outbound&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanonizer.com%2Ftopic.asp%2F81%2F4">Steven Lehar</a>, <a class="external"  title="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/17" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Outbound&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcanonizer.com%2Ftopic.asp%2F81%2F17">John Smythies</a> and a growing number of others.  But perhaps this early lead is just because supporters of some other more well accepted theory of consciousness haven't yet started supporting their ideas here?  
</p><p>There is obviously always the possibility that demonstrable scientific results are about to be achieved that will convert everyone to the 'true' camp.  Surely such, the scientific discovery of what the mind truly is, would be amongst the greatest scientific achievements of all time.
